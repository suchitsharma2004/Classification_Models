# Classification_Models
This repository contains some the the widely used Machine Learning Classification models. They help predict which class does the data belong to.
The csv file contains the sample data used in predicting test cases.
Additional models(Decision Tree and Random Forest) are included in the 'Naive Bayes' model as comments, to prevent making multiple files as most of the code was similar.
